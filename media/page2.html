            <p class="para1">The mosque and mausoleum in Egypt is located in the city of Cairo in the Sayeda Zainab district.
                It is not known precisely when the mosque was built on top of the tomb of Sayyida Zainab. The historical references only mention that the Ottoman governor of Egypt, 
                Ali Pasha, renovated the mosque in 951 AH / 1547 AD and then renovated it again, Prince Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in 1171 AH / 1768 AD, 
                and in 1940 AD. The Ministry of Awqaf completely demolished the old mosque and built the existing mosque, so the mosque is not registered as an Islamic monument. 
                The mosque at that time consisted of seven corridors parallel to the qibla wall, in the middle of which is a square courtyard covered with a dome. 
                On the opposite side of the qibla wall is the tomb of Sayyida Zainab, may God be pleased with her, surrounded by a brass fence and topped by a tall dome.
                In 1969, the Ministry of Awqaf doubled the area of ​​the mosque.</p>

        <p class="para1">Historians are unanimously agreed that Sayeda Aisha came to Egypt and died there.
            Al-Sakhawi says in “Tuhfat Al-Ahbab” that Mrs. Aisha is buried in Egypt. At first, the tomb of Mrs. Aisha was small and simple, 
            then the Fatimids and Ayyubids took care of its architecture, 
            where they established a school next to the shrine for memorizing the Holy Qur’an.
            When Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi surrounded Cairo, Al-Askar, Al-Qatay’ and Al-Fustat with a wall separating the dome of Aisha and al-Qarafa,
            then he opened a door in the wall to al-Qarafa, which was called Bab Aisha, and is now known as the Qarafa Gate.
            And attached to the shrine is a mosque known as the Mosque of Sayyida Aisha, rebuilt by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the year
            1176 AH / 1762 AD.
            Then the mosque was demolished and rebuilt in 1971 AD as it is now.</p>

        <p class="para1">This mosque is one of the hanging mosques.
            It is built on a high mound known as " Al-Kabsh ". The mosque has a distinct facade of a minaret or a minaret similar to an incense burner with a square base built of stone, and the rest of the minaret is built of bricks and its end is decorated with wood.
            It has two domes of identical shape and decoration, with rectangular lines and varying in height, and is characterized by its high windows stacked next to each other to give it a more beautiful look.
            The date of construction of the mosque is written on the threshold of this door, which is the year 703 AH / 1303 AD.
            Standing on the bench of the sea gate, we see three openings, one of which leads to the mosque, which consists of an open courtyard and the qibla iwan, the second to the minaret, and the third to a corridor separating the courtyard from the tomb of Salar and Sinjar, 
            and in the mosque there are retreats for Sufi worship.
            The mosque was established by Prince Salar Al-Nasiri and Prince Sanjar Al-Jawli and they were buried in the mosque.

            And he became the deputy of the Sultan, working in the service of the princes and the veil until the Sultan got angry and ordered his arrest and imprisonment and then killing him in the year 734 AH / 1334 AD, 
            due to his misbehavior during the absence of the Sultan in the Hejaz lands for Hajj.
            He was buried in the tomb located in his mosque. The mosque is located outside Bab Zuweila on Helmeya Street from the side of Muhammad Ali Street, Al-Darb Al-Ahmar Department.
