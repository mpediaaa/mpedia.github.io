 <p> This is the sarcophagus
              of Queen Kawit, the wife 
               
                  next drink. She holds a mirror in her free hand. In another scene, she is shown holding a lotus flower to her nose while dipping her finger in an unguent container held up by a servant. Her chest lies in front of her, the jewelry inside it depicted one on top of the other. Other scenes show cows being milked or calves breastfeeding. The combination of beauty, seen in the mirror, jewelry, and unguent, together with the lotus, the cows, and milk, together form very clear allusions to fertility, youth, rebirth, and Hathor, the goddess of love, beauty, fertility, music, and motherhood.
