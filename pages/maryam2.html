  <p>
    The advent of Mark the Apostle in 62 AD to Alexandria was the beginning of the Coptic Church in Egypt, where he preached Christianity to its people, establishing the Apostolic See of Alexandria,
    known as the Coptic Church. The Coptic (Mark) Church has a great place in the world history of the Church, because the Coptic Patriarchs of Alexandria were scholars who faced various heresies.
    The first to believe in Christianity was an Egyptian shoemaker called Anyanos, and he turned his house to be the first church in Africa, which was known as the Bukalia Church,
     and its location is the location of the current St. Mark's Cathedral, and this place is in the middle of ancient Alexandria.
