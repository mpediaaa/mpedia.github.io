                Babylon fortress in Coptic Cairo at the Mar Gerges metro station. Emperor Trajan ordered its construction in the second century AD during the Roman occupation of Egypt,
                 and he worked in it for renovations, expansions and the strength of the Roman Emperor Arcadius in the fourth century, according to the opinion of Mark Mark Samika Pasha.
                 The fortress of Babylon (Trajan Castle) is different from the old fortress that the historian Strabo wrote about.
                </p>
            <p>Stones were used in the construction of the Babylon Fortress, which were taken from Pharaonic temples and completed with red bricks, measuring 30/20/15 cm.
                The Babylonian fortress fell into the hands of Amr ibn al-Aas after a siege that lasted about seven months in the year 641. Amr ibn al-Aas chose a desert place that is considered militarily a strategic location north of the Babylonian fortress. He built the city of Fustat on such a hill bordered by Mokattam Mountain from the east and by the desert, and the Nile from the west. , and the ford of the turkey pond from the south, and they are natural barriers. Amr ibn al-Aas built the city of Fustat as a fortress city,
                 and in it was the fortress of Babylon, in order for it to remain a city for the Arab soldiers. </p>
                 <p>
                    The Roman fortress is known as the Wax Palace or the Babylon Castle. It covers an area of ​​about half a square kilometre, and contains the Coptic Museum, six Coptic churches and a monastery.
                     The name Qasr Al Wax for this fort is also due to the fact that at the beginning of each month he used to light candles on one of the fort’s towers on which the sun appears, and people know the fuel of wax as the sun moves from one tower to another.

        <p>This temple dedicated to the goddess Isis , which was flooded by the waters of the Nile, was divided and reassembled in a new location on the island of Agilika , about 500 m from its original place on the island of Philae .
                Egypt was a prosperous part of the Roman Empire , it became really rich and several new cities were built in it. One of the most famous facilities in Egypt in the Roman era is the so-called Pharaoh ’s bed, i.e. Trajan ’s kiosk</p>
        <p> The temples of Philae were originally built to worship the goddess Isis .
                In all centuries, elephants gained a special place in cults to the extent that a crowd of followers of that cult used to gather to commemorate the story of the death and resurrection of Osiris .
                The great temple was built during the third century BC, followed by the temples of Amenhotep and Arsnovis . As for the Temple of Hathor , it is the last Ptolemaic monument and its construction was completed before 116 BC by Euergetes II . Other Ptolemies added inscriptions to Philae, which is considered one of the masterpieces of the temple. From Egypt, the worship of the goddess Isis extended to Greece , Rome and throughout the empire. Even when Roman rule was implemented in Egypt, the rulers tried to beautify the holy island. Emperor Augustus Caesar built a temple at the northern end of Elephant in the ninth century BC. As for Tiberius and others, they added monuments and inscriptions, as he builtClaudius , Trajan, Hadrian and Diocletian are new buildings on the island, and work continued on them until the fourth century AD.
                The intensity of the control of the cult of Isis on the island of Philae led to the extension of that cult over many centuries in defiance of the decree of Emperor Theodosius I issued in 391 AD, which imposed the Christian religion on all parts of the Roman Empire . In 550 AD, under Justinian 's rule , Christianity reached the island of Philae and a new page began in its history. A new Christian community was formed on the island of Philae, and the colonnade hall was transformed to be an occasion for practicing the new religion. Stones were removed from some ruins to build Christian churches on the island. A new village grew around the Temple of Isis.
                When Islam came, elephants were considered a legendary fortress represented in one of the stories of the Thousand and One Nights, and acquired the name Anas al-Wujud after the name of the hero of one of these stories from the Thousand and One Nights stories</p>
        <p>  A large number of temples were erected on the island of Philae, perhaps the oldest of those temples dating back to the reign of King Thutmose III (1490-1436 BC). In the fourth century BC, the king " Nakht-Nabf " (378-341 BC) built a huge temple, and after him, " Ptolemy Philadelphia " (3rd century BC) built his great temple, then many of the Ptolemaic kings and Roman rulers followed him until the island of Philae was crowded with temples. The most famous of them is the one called " Pharaoh's Chamber ".
                        There are also a large number of statues of the kings of ancient Egypt above the island of Philae.
                        The first ruins on the island of Philae date back to the reign of King Taharqa ( the twenty-fifth dynasty ). The temple of Isis is one of the largest and most important monuments in the group of large and small temples on the island of Philae. This temple occupies about a quarter of the island's area . ( The Thirtieth Dynasty ), two rows of columns dating back to the Roman era , the Greek-Roman Aresnovis Temple , the Mandulis Temple (from the Roman period), the Imhotep Temple (from the Ptolemaic period ),
                         and one of the most important small temples surrounding the large group of temples is the Temple of Hathor (Ptolemaic period). Trajan's cabin. </p><br>

        <p>he Black Head Temple is an archaeological temple that was discovered by chance in 1936 AD by chance in the Ras al-Aswada area of ​​Sidi Bishr . To save the temple, the SCA decided to move the temple in 1995, and a high site was chosen for it within the area of ​​the Latin cemetery in the center of Alexandria, in front of the Bab Sharq district police station on Al-Hurriya Road. It took six months to dismantle the temple stones and reconstruct them in the new place. And the remaining part of it now is not a temple in the understandable sense, but is a small structure. The Latin cemetery known as "Alabaster" dates back to the early Ptolemaic period.</p>
        <p><q>Temple layout</q><br>
                first floor:<br>
                The temple consists of two floors, the lower of which is dedicated to worship, while the upper one is for the residence of the temple's priests. This is why this temple is considered one of the unique temples among the Greek and Roman temples in Egypt in terms of planning. The temple was built - as usual in Roman temples - on a high floor that can be reached by ten steps of stairs in the front facade of the temple only. Those steps are built across the entire facade of the building. Stairs lead to an atrium topped by four marble columns with an Ionic crown. In the center of the columns stands a small pillar topped by a votive foot that is related to the story of the temple's construction. Behind the columns is the main room of the temple, which is a square room, and attached to the northern wall is a terrace of stone topped by five statues of white marble: a statue of Isis, a statue of Harpocrates, the third of "Hermanopis", and two statues of Canopic Osiris, the gods of the temple, all of which are currently in the Greco-Roman Museum.<br>                  second floor:<br>
                 It is accessed via a narrow staircase in the eastern wall of the temple, and houses the dwelling of the priests. It consists of two rooms similar in the way they were built with the first floor, which indicates that it is from the same era as the temple and is not an addition from later eras. The two rooms were largely destroyed, and there are no inscriptions on the inner or outer walls of the temple.
                Consecration of the Temple: The Temple of the Black Head was consecrated by a knight called "Isidore", meaning "the gift of Isis", who had fallen from his chariot and injured his foot. When his foot was healed, he made a vow to Isis, which is a white marble foot wearing a shoe erected on a square column of The marble is inscribed with an inscription in Greek that says: "Isidore gave the image of this foot to the gods who preserved it after the fatal fall from the chariot." What is meant by the goddess here is the goddess Isis, to whom that temple was dedicated. The temple dates from the middle of the second century AD</p><br>
