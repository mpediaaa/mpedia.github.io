            <p >The Roman theater in Alexandria in Kom El-Dikka is one of the monuments of the Roman era and was established at the beginning of the fourth century AD .
                There is another theater in Egypt, which is the Blossom Theater, which is located in the Pelusium antiquities area, 25 km east of the Suez Canal <br>This building was discovered by chance, while removing dirt to search for the tomb of Alexander the Great by a Polish expedition in 1960 . Archaeologists called it the Roman theater when the marble steps were discovered, but a great controversy arose about the function of this ancient building.  It took about 30 years to excavate.
                The Polish mission continued its mission with the University of Alexandria until some study halls were discovered next to this amphitheater in February 2004 , and this will change the trend that the Roman amphitheater is a theater; This amphitheater may have been used as a large lecture hall for students , and in celebrations it was used as a theater Third</p>
            <p>The building is a horseshoe or u-shaped building and consists of 13 rows of marble terraces numbered with Greek letters and numbers to organize the seating process, the first from the bottom, and it can accommodate about 600 people.  They are made of pink granite , and there are 5 booths on top of these stands, of which there are only two booths left. The ceiling of these booths had domes based on a group of columns, and the stands were based on a thick wall of limestone surrounded by another wall.
                 The two walls were linked by a group of Arches and vaults where the outer wall is a strong support for the inner wall. There are also two mosaic halls with geometric motifs at the entrance to the west </p><br>

        <p>  The catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa is a historical archaeological site located in Alexandria , in the Kom el Shoqafa area south of Mina El Basal neighborhood. It is considered one of the most important cemeteries of the city , and is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.  The cemetery consists of a series of Alexandrian tombs, statues, and archaeological remains of the pharaonic funeral cult. Because of the time period at that time, many features of the catacombs in Kom el Shoqafa combine Roman, Greek and Egyptian cultural points.
            Some of the statues were made in Egyptian styles, but carried Roman styles of clothing and hair style, while others shared a similar style. There is a circular staircase in the middle of it, leading to the tombs that were excavated inside the rock during the era of the Antonine emperors (2nd century AD), and it was mostly used to transport the dead bodies. The importance of the cemetery is due to its vastness, the large number of its decorations, and the complexity of its planning.
             It is also considered one of the clearest examples of the overlapping of Pharaonic art with Roman art in the city and the finest examples of funerary architecture. Since 1892 , the tomb was only found by chance on September 28, 1900 </p>
            <p>The excavation began in the Kom El Shoqafa area in 1892, but a hole was discovered in the ceiling of the cemetery by chance in 1900 AD. The cemetery is of the Katacomb type, a type of cemetery that spread in the first three centuries AD, and the Catacombe cemetery is the main cemetery in the Kom El Shoqafa area. It bore this name due to the similarity in planning between them and the Christian catacombs in Rome, and the name Katacombe, a term used for graves dug under the surface of the earth .</p>
             <p>The cemetery consists of a spiral staircase connecting the three floors, and the staircase whose lower steps are higher, then the height of the steps gradually decreases until it is almost non-existent near the surface of the earth .
                It is considered the largest public Roman tomb that was found in Alexandria. It is located on the borders of the western cemetery in ancient Alexandria, and it dates back to the second century AD .
                This ancient cemetery is located in the Kom El Shoqafa area in the Karmouz neighborhood and behind the current Muslim cemeteries .. This area is part of the ancient city of Alexandria .</p>
            <p>The name of Kom El Shoqafa is the Arabic name given to the area in revival of the ancient Greek name.. Kom El Shoqafa is located in the area established by the village of Rakotis.. It is the name by which it was known to the Romans as a revival of the ancient Pharaonic name of the village, which is Ra.
                 I have discovered this cemetery ( the cemetery) By chance in 1892 AD, it was finally revealed in 1900 AD </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><b>History of the cemetery</b> <br>
                The layout of the cemetery, the complexity of the tombs, their sequence, and the different decorative elements in them make us believe that this cemetery was not built in one go. The excavations confirmed that the cemetery expanded during the following centuries, but the similarity of the architectural and decorative elements makes us not extend the period during which the cemetery was expanded to a long time, and the cemetery returns, or rather the oldest part of it. (i.e. the main cemetery) to the period between the first and second centuries AD (the end of the first and middle of the second century), and this is confirmed by the presence of the prominent sculpture that we see in the main cemetery, as well as the correct Egyptian drawings that date back to the middle of the Roman era (where there is a date in the year 6996 AD and also Date of the year 117
                138 for the era of Emperor Hadrian. Coins dating back to the period between the reign of Triman and the reign of Clinius the Younger were also found. It seems that the tomb continued to be used until the beginning of the fourth century AD, then it was neglected.</p><br>

             <p>The Pillar Column is an ancient Roman column located in the city of Alexandria in Egypt , and is one of the most famous monuments in it. It was built on the hill of Bab Sidra, between the present Muslim burial area, known as the Al -Amoud burial ground , and the ancient Kom Al-Shaqafa plateau. It is about 27 meters long and made of red granite . It was held in honor of Emperor Diocletian in the third century AD . It is the last surviving relics of the Temple of the Serapeum , which was set up by Postumus .  It is considered the tallest monument in the world. The exact date of the establishment of this column has not been determined,
                  but it dates back to the Roman era, and it was said that this column was dedicated to Christianity after its victory in Alexandria, Ali Miriam in the Battle of the Shirt</p>
                  <p>he name of the column dates back to the Arab era, where it is believed that it came as a result of the height of this towering column among 400 other columns, which is similar to the masts of ships . Therefore, the Arabs called it the masts column , which was later distorted into the masts.  The pole of the pole has been mistakenly known since the Crusades as Pompeyâ€™s Column. This error is due to the fact that some Europeans thought that the head of the Roman commander Pompey , who fled to Egypt to escape from Julius Caesar and was killed in Egypt, thought that his head had been placed in a precious funerary urn and placed over a crown column</p>
                  <p>The body of the column is a single piece with a diameter of 2.70 meters at the base and 2.30 meters at the crown. The total height of the column, including the base, is about 26.85 meters.  On the western side of the column are two bases that can be accessed by an underground ladder. There are also two statues similar to the Sphinx made of pink granite, dating back to the era of Ptolemy VI .  On one of them is an inscription of King Horemheb of the Eighteenth Dynasty .</p><br>
