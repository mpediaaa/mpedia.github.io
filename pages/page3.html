             Al-Muizz Al-Deen Street, named for the first Fatimid Caliph in Egypt, was built as the main street through the Fatimid’s grand city
                and while much of the Fatimid capital was destroyed when subsequent Sunni Caliphates regained control of the city,
                 Muizz Street retained its importance. Many of the palaces, mosques, and monuments of the Ayyubid, Mamluk,
                  and Ottoman rulers that controlled Egypt after the Fatimids continued to be built along this street through the center of the city.
               Today, Al-Muizz Street still displays the greatest density of significant Islamic monuments anywhere in the world to this day.
               Running the length of Islamic Cairo’s central core, from Bab Al-Futuh in the north to Bab Zuweila in the south, it is one of the most important places in Egypt’s Islamic history.
                In addition the impressive monuments scattered along its length, it also hosts a bustling neighborhood,
                 home to thousands of craftsmen making wares to be sold in Khan Al-Khalili,
                 which marks the streets midpoint.
                  A walk down this street, ending with a stroll through the maze of shops in Khan Al-Khalili, is an essential part of any visit to Cairo.<br>

                <p class="p67">
              The Mosque of al-Hakim, abutting the Northern Walls, commemorates one of Egypt’s most notorious rulers. Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah
              was only 11 years old when he became the 6th Fatimid caliph, and 15 when he had his tutor murdered.
              His reign (996-1021) was characterized by the persecutions of Christians, Jews and merchants, and by rabid misogyny:<br>
              he forbade women to leave their homes and once had a group of noisy females boiled alive in a public bath.
              Merchants found guilty of cheating during Al-Hakim’s inspections were summarily sodomized by his Nubian slave, Masoud,
              while the caliph stood upon their heads.

              The mosque was thereafter shunned or used for profane purpose until 1980,
              when it was restored by a group of Bohara Isma’ili Shi’ites from India who have dedicated themselves to looking after Cairo’s Fatimid mosques.<br>
              Their addition of brass lamps, glass chandeliers and a new mihrab outraged purist, but the original wooden tie-beams and stucco frieze beneath the ceiling remain.
              From the roof, you can gaze over Bab el-Nasr Cemetery and admire the mosque’s minarets, which resemble bastions and are its only original features.
              One advantage of modernization is the courtyard has some degree of wheelchair access,
              ( via the side door, to the left of the main one; you’ll need to get someone to open it for you).<br>

                        <p class="p67">
              By the time of the powerful Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali, who ruled Egypt from 1074 to 1094, Cairo had outgrown the sun-dried brick wall of Jawhar.
               This, coupled with the attempts of the Turkoman Atsiz to take Cairo, among other threats from the East, spurred al-Jamali to rebuild the walls of the city,
                                          including three new gates.
              The Gate (Bab) of al-Futuh, along with the Bab al-Nasr was built in 1087, and the Bab Zuwayla was built in 1092.<br>
                An Armenian himself, al-Jamali is reported to have employed Armenians from northern Mesopotamia as well as Syrians in a vast building campaign which he embarked on shortly after he assumed power.
                 This work marks the beginning of a newly cultivated taste for stone in Cairo.
               The Bab al-Nasr marks the northern limits respectively of the Fatimid city and function as termini for al Mu'iz Street,
               the major Fatimid north-south spine where Le Riad de Charme is located.<br>

                              <p>
                   Bab al‑Futuh (Gate of Conquests) is one of the gates in the northern wall of Fatimid Cairo.
                   It opens onto the historic al‑Mu’izz Street, which leads to the only surviving southern gate of the city, Bab Zuwayla.
                   It was built by the vizier and commander‑in‑chief, Badr al‑Jamali, during the reign of the Fatimid Caliph al‑Mustansir Billah.<br>
                  This stone structure was built farther north than the older, brick, gate of Jawhar al‑Siqilli, thus both giving the city room to expand, as well as tougher defenses.
                 Bab al‑Futuh and Bab al‑Nasr, both of which were built in 480 AH/1087 AD, along with Bab Zuwayla (480 AH/1092 AD),
               are among the rare examples of military architecture in the Islamic world prior to the Crusades.<br>
