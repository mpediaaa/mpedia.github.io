  This museum is located in ancient Egypt within the boundaries of the Babylon fortress, whose remains are located behind the museum building; Its construction began in the days of the Persians,
   but many additions took place during the reign of the Roman Emperors Augustus and Trajan,
  and then those who came after them from the Roman emperors added to it. The French scientist (Maspero) played an important role in the establishment of the museum,
   as he worked on collecting works of Coptic art and allocating a hall for them in the Egyptian Museum. After that,
   Mark Pasha Samika demanded in 1893 AD that the Coptic antiquities group be included in the interests of the Committee for Preserving Antiquities and Arts. This man struggled for a long time until he was able to establish the current building of the museum, which was opened in 1910 and appointed as its first director. The first guide to the museum was published in 1930

  <p class="h-sant">St. Catherine's Monastery</p>
On the slopes of Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God, is located one of the oldest working monasteries in the world. Commonly known as sant chathrine's Monastery, its actual name is "The Holy Monastery of God on Mount Sinai".
It was built by order of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527-565 AD) in 548-565 AD.
St. Catherine was martyred in the early fourth century AD, as the monastery bears her name because her monks discovered her body near Mount St. Catherine in the ninth century AD.
The monastery includes multiple structures, the most important of wh
ich is the Church of the Transfiguration of Christ the Savior, which in itself includes nine smaller churches.
. St. Catherine's Monastery also includes ten other churches, monks' quarters, a refectory, an olive press, burial caskets,
a 12th-century Fatimid mosque, and a library of rare books and 6000 manuscripts</p>
<hr>
<p class="p-san"><b>St. Catherine's Foundation</b></p>
<p>The St Catherine's Foundation is a UK-based non-profit organization that aims to preserve the Abbey.
   Preserving its architectural structures, paintings, and books forms a large part of the foundation's purpose.
   The St. Catherine Foundation works with its academic partner, the Legatos Research Center at the University of the Arts, London,
   to raise awareness of the Abbey's unique cultural significance through lectures, books and articles.
   Founded on 2 November 2007 at the Royal Geographical Society in London,
   it is in need of fresh funds for its preservation workshop, digitization studio and a full set of preservation
   funds designed to protect the Abbey's most vulnerable manuscripts.</p>

  <p class="h-moalaqa" style="color:brown;" >the hanging Church</p>
According to the Bible, God commanded Moses to expel the children of Israel from Egypt when he spoke to him at the blazing bush who,
despite the presence of fire, was not affected by its flame. Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great (272-337 AD), the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity,
 built a church on the site of the Burning Bush in the fourth century AD.
 The Emperor Justinian I (527-565 AD) also rebuilt it, which made it inside the large Church of the Transfiguration of Christ the Savior that he built.
The site of the burning bush is marked by a small altar on a marble floor located directly above its roots.
On the other side of the wall behind the altar, the flaming tree that has been inside the church to this day shines bright.

<p  class="comp-mo">
    The facade of the church is located on the western side on Mary Gerges Street,
    and it has two floors. There is a fountain in front of it. It was built in the famous basilica style,
    consisting of 3 wings, a front hall and a structure divided into 3 parts. It is rectangular in shape,
    and is relatively small, with dimensions of about 23.5 meters in length, 18.5 meters in width and 9.5 meters in height.
   It consists of a main nave and two small wings, and between them eight columns on each side,
   and between the nave and the northern wing, there is a row of three columns with large pointed arches,
   and the columns separating the wings are of marble, except for one of black basalt. Column capitals "Corinthian" style.
   On the eastern side of the church there are three structures[?]: the middle bears the name of the Virgin Mary,
   the right is the name of Saint John the Baptist, and the left is named after Saint Mary George.

    In front of these structures, there are wooden veils, the most important of which is the middle veil made of ebony inlaid with transparent ivory,
     dating back to the twelfth or thirteenth century, and inscribed on it with beautiful geometric shapes and crosses[?],
     and above it are icons depicting Christ on a throne, and to his right the Virgin Mary and the angel Gabriel and Saint Peter,
      and to his left John the Baptist and the angel Michael and Saint Paul, and at the top of the altar inside this temple there is a wooden canopy based on four pillars, and behind it is the seating platform for the priests. In the right wing of the church, fragments of Egyptian national newspapers were hung on one of the walls, narrating events and scenes from the modern history of the church, related to the Copts in Egypt, perhaps the most important of which is the appearance of the Virgin Mary in her church in the Zeitoun neighborhood in the wake of the defeat of the 1967 war.
