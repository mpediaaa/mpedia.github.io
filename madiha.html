          <h2>Alexander-The-Great</h2>
          <p>Alexander was born in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon,
             on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion, which probably
             corresponds to 20 July 356 BC (although the exact date is uncertain).
             He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias,
             daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus.[11] Although Philip had seven or eight wives,
              Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.</p>
          <p>Alexander III of Macedon (Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος Alexandros; 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC),
             commonly known as Alexander the Great,[a] was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon.
              He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20, and spent most
              of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Northeastern Africa.
               By the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.
                He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most successful military commanders.</p>

          <h2>Ptlomey i</h2>
          <p>A Macedonian,[3] Ptolemy was born in 367 BC.[4] Ptolemy's mother was Arsinoe. According to Satyrus the Peripatetic,
            Arsinoe was a descendant of Alexander I of Macedon and thus a member of the Argead dynasty, claiming ultimate descent
             from Heracles. Ostensibly, Ptolemy's father was Lagus, a Macedonian nobleman from Eordaea, but many ancient sources
              claim that he was actually an illegitimate son of Philip II of Macedon. If true, this would have made Ptolemy the half-brother
               of Alexander. It is probable that this is a later myth fabricated to glorify the Ptolemaic dynasty.</p>
          <p>Ptolemy I Soter (/ˈtɒləmi/; Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Σωτήρ, Ptolemaîos Sōtḗr "Ptolemy the Savior";
            c. 367 BC – January 282 BC) was an Ancient Macedonian general, historian and companion of Alexander the Great of the Kingdom of
             Macedon in northern Greece who became ruler of Egypt, part of Alexander's former empire. Ptolemy was pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt from 305/304 BC
              to his death. He was the founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt until the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC,
              turning the country into a Hellenistic kingdom and Alexandria into a center of Greek culture.</p>

          <h2>Ptlomey iii</h2>
          <p>Ptolemy III Euergetes (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Εὐεργέτης, romanized: Ptolemaios Euergetes,
            "Ptolemy the Benefactor"; c. 280 – November/December 222 BC) was the third pharaoh of the
            Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt from 246 to 222 BC. The Ptolemaic Kingdom reached the height of its
            military and economic power during his kingship, as initiated by his father Ptolemy II Philadelphus.</p>

          <p>Ptolemy III was born some time around 280 BC, as the eldest son of Ptolemy II and his
            first wife Arsinoe I, daughter of King Lysimachus of Thrace. His father had become co-regent of Egypt in
            284 BC and sole ruler in 282 BC. Around 279 BC, the collapse of Lysimachus' kingdom led to the return to Egypt
             of Ptolemy II's sister Arsinoe II, who had been married to Lysimachus. A conflict quickly broke out between Arsinoe
              I and Arsinoe II. Sometime after 275 BC, Arsinoe I was charged with conspiracy and exiled to Coptos. When Ptolemy
              II married Arsinoe II probably in 273/2 BC, her victory in this conflict was complete. As children of Arsinoe I,
              Ptolemy III and his two siblings seem to have been removed from the succession after their mother's fall.
              This political background may explain why Ptolemy III seems to have been raised on Thera in the Aegean, rather than in Egypt.
             His tutors included the poet and polymath Apollonius of Rhodes, later head of the Library of Alexandria.</p>

          <h2>Ptlomey viii</h2>
          <p>Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II Tryphon[note 1] (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Εὐεργέτης Τρύφων,
            Ptolemaĩos Euergétēs Tryphon "Ptolemy the Benefactor, the luxurious"; c. 184 BC – 28 June 116 BC),
            nicknamed Physcon (Φύσκων "Fatty"), was a king of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. He was the younger son of Ptolemy
            V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra. His reign was characterised by fierce political and military conflict with his older
            brother Ptolemy VI Philometor and his sister Cleopatra II.</p>

          <p>Ptolemy was the younger son of Ptolemy V Epiphanes, who reigned from 204 to 180 BC.
             Ptolemy V's reign had been dominated by the Fifth Syrian War (204–198 BC), in which the
              Ptolemaic realm fought against the Seleucid king Antiochus III, who ruled the Near East and Asia Minor.
               In that war, Antiochus III had completely defeated the Ptolemaic forces, had annexed Coele-Syria and Judaea
                to his empire, and reduced Egypt to a subordinate position.[3] The new situation was solidified with a peace treaty,
                in which Ptolemy V married Antiochus' daughter Cleopatra I in 194 BC.[4] Ptolemy VI Philometor was the eldest son of the couple,
                 born in 186 BC, and was the heir to the throne from birth. The exact date of Ptolemy VIII's birth is unknown, but it was probably around 184 BC.
                  He also had an elder sister, Cleopatra II, who was probably born between 186 and 184 BC.</p>

          <h2>cleopatra vii</h2>
          <p>Cleopatra VII Philopator (Greek: Κλεοπάτρα Φιλοπάτωρ;
            69 BC – 10 August 30 BC) was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51 to 30 BC,
             and its last active ruler.A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant
             of its founder Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great.
              After the death of Cleopatra, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end of the second to
               last Hellenistic state and the age that had lasted since the reign of Alexander (336–323 BC).
               Her native language was Koine Greek, and she was the only Ptolemaic ruler to learn the Egyptian language.</p>

          <p>The Latinized form Cleopatra comes from the Ancient Greek Kleopátra (Κλεοπάτρα),
             meaning "glory of her father",from κλέος (kléos, "glory") and πατήρ (patḗr,
             "father"). The masculine form would have been written either as Kleópatros (Κλεόπατρος)
              or Pátroklos (Πάτροκλος).[7] Cleopatra was the name of Alexander the Great's sister,
              as well as Cleopatra Alcyone, wife of Meleager in Greek mythology.[8] Through the marriage of Ptolemy
              V Epiphanes and Cleopatra I Syra (a Seleucid princess), the name entered the Ptolemaic dynasty. Cleopatra's
               adopted title Theā́ Philopátōra (Θεᾱ́ Φιλοπάτωρα) means "goddess who loves her father".</p>

      <h2>Ptloemy xii</h2>
      <p>Ptolemy XII (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος Ptolemaios;[note 1] c. 117 – 51 BC) was a Pharaoh of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, who ruled from 80 to 58
         BC and then again from 55 BC until his death in 51 BC. He was commonly known as Auletes (Αὐλητής, "the Flautist"),
        referring to his love of playing the flute in Dionysian festivals. As a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, he was a descendant of its founder, Ptolemy I.</p>

      <p>Ptolemy XII was the oldest son of Ptolemy IX Soter. The identity of his mother is uncertain. Ptolemy IX was married twice,
        to his sister Cleopatra IV from around 119 BC until he was forced to divorce her in 115 BC, and secondly to another sister Cleopatra
         Selene from 115 BC, until he abandoned her during his flight from Alexandria in 107 BC.
        However, Cicero and other ancient sources refer to Ptolemy XII as an illegitimate son; Pompeius Trogus called him a "nothos"
        (bastard), while Pausanias wrote that Ptolemy IX had no legitimate sons at all.[1][2] Some scholars have therefore proposed that
         his mother was a concubine – probably an Alexandrian Greek,[3][4][5][6][7] but possibly a member of the Egyptian elite.
          However, Chris Bennett argues that Ptolemy XII's mother was Cleopatra IV and that he was considered illegitimate simply
          because she had never been co-regent.This theory is endorsed by the historian Adrian Goldsworthy.</p>

     <h2>Alexandria Library</h2>

     <p >Alexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning,
     in part because of the Great Library.Many important and influential scholars
      worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including,
      among many others: Zenodotus of Ephesus, who worked towards standardizing the
       texts of the Homeric poems; Callimachus, who wrote the Pinakes, sometimes
       considered to be the world's first library catalogue; Apollonius of Rhodes,
        who composed the epic poem the Argonautica; Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who calculated
        the circumference of the earth within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy;
        Aristophanes of Byzantium, who invented the system of Greek diacritics and was
         the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and Aristarchus of Samothrace,
         who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive
         commentaries on them. During the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes,
          a daughter library was established in the Serapeum, a temple to the
          Greco-Egyptian god Serapis.
